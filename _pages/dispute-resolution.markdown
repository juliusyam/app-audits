description1:
    Unfortunately situations arise where the expected result and the actual result don't quite align. Occasionally, due 
    to miscommunication or a falling out during the development process, despite the final product looking as it should, 
    there are questions or doubts about whether the application actually performs as expected.
    <br />
    <br />
    Our Dispute Resolution service is intended to help resolve these situations prior to resorting to litigation.
    Having a review of both the codebase and the application will allow our team to provide independent, unbiased insight
    into the inner workings and quality of your application. This includes performance, process and functionalty, so that
    you can be confident in the output of your supplier.
