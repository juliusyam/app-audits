        We perform an unbiased review of existing systems and procedures, insulated from company politics to allow Product Managers, C-levels and Directors to know exactly what software assets they are responsible for and how it comes together to meet the business requirements.



        We perform a confidential, independent review of the code, designs, documentation and usability of your concept or your potential purchase. We then prepare a document broken down into in both layman's and technician's terms to describe the system that exists couched in the end goal you are oping to achieve by engaging with the business or IP looking to engage with.
